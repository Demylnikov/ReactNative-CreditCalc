# ReactNative-CreditCalc
Basic mortgage and financing calculator created using React Native framework

Includes both Android and iOS projects in corresponding folders.
The code for iOS is in App.js while the code for Android is in index.android.js. This is because React Native apps are not supposed to use single codebase and App.js was used as such, but due to problems iOS and Android now have different code in different files.
